List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them. (ex. password inputs can be used for login forms):

	text - you would use this for inputting in text like names or towns not from a list
	checkbox - when you want to give only certain options and when you want people to be able to pick more than one.
	file picker - when you want the person to upload a file into the website 

In your own words, write definitions (no more than one sentence) for client, server, and API.

	client - the user end of the web - you your computer, your smartphone etc. that makes requests to the server.
	server - a computer(or many) with no real gui but who clients request info from to transport information on the web. 
	API - data from some entity in a form where computers can access and manipulate it easliy - it allows for a lot of interaction between websites. 

question?

how come in lesson 3 of the API  it would work when the content type and the data format matched but the accept header did not? it also gave a different type of information... whats going on here?
